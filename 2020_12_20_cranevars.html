            <p>This project was a study on curved folding. 
                No scoring (laser or hand) was used. Instead, 
                curves were formed by creasing, then smoothing 
                out bumps with a stylus (the tip of my 
                mechanical pencil). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Tsuru is not traditional. In order to create 
                enough layers to shape, I made a 30 degree version 
                of the traditional crane and added a diagonal graft.

            <p>
                Houou and Kotobuki Tsuru are more or less folded from traditional bases.
            </p>
            <p>
                All three birds are folded from tissue foil.
