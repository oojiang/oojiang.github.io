            <p>What does the name "ogelsir" mean?</p>
            <p>
                "ogelsir" is a handle that I have used on many websites 
                ever since I created the name in elementary school. Naturally,
                I have received many questions about the name "ogelsir" since then.
                And just as naturally, the way I answer such questions has evolved 
                over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I came up with "ogelsir", I was just a kid who liked legos and
                kungfu. So, "ogelsir" was a mash between "ogel", or "lego" reversed,
                and "sir", the title I used to address my masters at the studio I 
                studied kungfu at.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I am no longer interested in legos, but I have picked up
                an interest in wordplay. And so, "ogelsir" has found a new meaning.
                "Lego" is an abbreviation of two Danish words "leg godt", meaning 
                "play well". If "ogel" is "lego" reversed, then it ought to mean 
                "well play". Joining "ogel" with "sir", we arrive at "well played sir".
                So I suppose the meaning of my handle is an internet meme.

                As a bonus, there's a little bit of meaning in my GitHub handle "oojiang" 
                as well. It's less interesting, but more intentional. When I was creating
                my GitHub account, "ojiang" was taken, so I had to come up with an alternative.
                I settled on "oojiang" because two "O"s together look like an infinity symbol âˆž,
