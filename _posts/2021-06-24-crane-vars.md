2. Houou (Pheonix)  
3. Tsuru (Crane)  


This project was a study on curved folding. 
No scoring (laser or hand) was used. Instead, 
curves were formed by creasing, then smoothing 
out bumps with a stylus (the tip of my 
mechanical pencil). 

The Tsuru is not traditional. In order to create 
enough layers to shape, I made a [30 degree version 
of the traditional crane and added a diagonal graft](/assets/tsuru_cp.svg). 

Houou and Kotobuki Tsuru are more or less folded from traditional bases.

All three birds are folded from tissue foil.

This project was from August 2019.
