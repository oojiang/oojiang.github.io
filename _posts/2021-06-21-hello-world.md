Welcome to my shiny new personal website! It is written using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), served using [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), and runs on a [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet in San Fransisco somewhere.

The theme for this website is a fork of [Parchment](https://rahul-bothra.github.io/parchment/), which is a fork of
[Researcher](https://ankitsultana.com/researcher/). While looking at various themes and blogs for inspiration, I noticed
that broken links are very common around the internet. Hopefully, the sites linked on this post do not disappear any time soon.

I chose this color palette based on the vim colorscheme [seoul256](https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim), which
is based on [Seoul Colors](https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085412/http://www.seoul.go.kr/v2012/seoul/symbol/color.html). The Seoul Colors webpage is one of those pesky pages that has been taken off the internet, so the link sends you to see the Wayback Machine's archive of it instead. I am a diehard fan of the [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) colorscheme, but I thought solarized colors didn't work quite as fabulously for a website as they do for my text editor.
